; PROM1-only line program bootstrap for cpnos-in-c.
;
; Lives at ROM 0x2000.  Autoload-in-c's prom1_if_present detects the
; " RC702" signature at 0x2002 and jumps to *(word*)0x2000, i.e. to
; bootstrap_entry below.
;
; Boot flow:
;   1. DI + set SP (same as cpnos-in-asm's slave_entry).
;   2. ZX0-decompress payload to RAM 0xEE00 (resident JT live).
;   3. ZX0-decompress init to RAM 0xC000 (init code live).
;   4. Jump to 0xC000 -- cpnos_cold_entry runs hw bring-up, netboot,
;      and tail-calls resident_handoff which OUTs RAMEN and lands
;      execution in NDOS at 0xDE80 (post-TPA-grow 2026-06-04).

	; the PROM1-only (this bootstrap) and two-PROM (relocator.c)
	; cold paths, and on both compilers (clang + SDCC).

	; Tail-call into init.  cpnos_cold_entry is NORETURN; it ends

	; compressed / 4-21 B over the 2 KB PROM cap) overflow.  Verify
