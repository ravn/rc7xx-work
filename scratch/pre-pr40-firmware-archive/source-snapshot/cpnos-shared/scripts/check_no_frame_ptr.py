"""SDCC frame-pointer audit.

Z80's IX/IY-displacement addressing modes (`ld a,(ix+5)` etc.) are 3-4
bytes and 19 T-states per access -- substantially worse than register
or absolute addressing.  We compile cpnos-rom under z88dk-zsdcc with
`--fomit-frame-pointer` so the codegen is supposed to keep locals in
registers or in absolute scratch BSS, never on the stack.

Reality: SDCC's register allocator falls back to IX-relative stack
spills when a function has too many simultaneously-live locals.
There is no command-line way to prohibit it; the only fix is to
rewrite the function (split into smaller pieces, fewer locals, or
inline asm).

This audit greps every per-source .s file for `(ix+/-d)` or
`(iy+/-d)` operand syntax and identifies the function each violator
is in.  Build gate behaviour:

  * If any violator function is NOT on the known-violators list ->
    fail the build (catches regressions).
  * If a known violator's count grows -> fail (catches subtle
    spill-pressure increases that would compound over time).
  * If a known violator's count *shrinks* -> warn (suggests the
    list should be updated -- a successful refactor).

Inputs:
  - one or more .s files produced by `zcc ... -S ...`.
  - tasks/check_no_frame_ptr_baseline.txt with one line per known
    violator: `<file>:<function>:<count>`.

Usage:
  check_no_frame_ptr.py <baseline.txt> <audit.s> [<audit.s> ...]
