; _mem_copy_backwards_callee — direction-known LDDR for callers that
; statically know dst > src (e.g. resident.c::insert_line).
;
; Caller passes END-pointers (last byte of each region) so this helper
; just does a single LDDR + ret.  No direction check, no add/dec
; preamble.  ~12 B, callee-cleanup z88dk ABI.

; The general overlap-safe `_memmove_callee` (~33 B) was removed from
; this file when its only caller (resident.c::insert_line) migrated to
; mem_copy_backwards.  No remaining call site for the general memmove.
; If a future caller emerges with unknown direction, either restore
; the helper here (overrides z88dk libc's 150 B `_memmove_callee`) or
; refactor the caller to use mem_copy_backwards.  Tracked as
; ravn/rc700-gensmedet#77.
