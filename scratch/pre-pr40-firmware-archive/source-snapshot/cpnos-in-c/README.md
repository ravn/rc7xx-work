# cpnos-rom — Combined CP/NOS client ROM for RC702

Single 4KB ROM image (two 2KB EPROMs: PROM0 @ 0x0000, PROM1 @ 0x2000) that
boots the RC702 as a CP/NOS client against an MP/M master over SIO-A
async 38400 baud, with optional 8" DSDD local diskette support.

## Status

2026-04-23: Initial+minimal version of CP/NOS client ROM, fully functional in MAME against z80pack

Phase 0 (scaffolding). See
[`../rcbios-in-c/tasks/cpnos-rom-plan.md`](../rcbios-in-c/tasks/cpnos-rom-plan.md)
for the full plan.

## How CP/NOS is split (the one-page version)

A CP/NOS slave like our RC702 has three software layers stacked between
the application program and "everything else". Two of those layers are
RC702-specific and live in this PROM; the third is generic DRI code
that arrives over the network as `cpnos.com`.

```
    +-------------------------------------+
    |   user program (CCP, MBASIC, ...)   |
    +-------------------------------------+
    |   BDOS    |   NDOS                  |   <-- cpnos.com (DRI, generic)
    +-----------+--------------+----------+
    |   BIOS                   |  SNIOS   |   <-- this PROM (RC702-specific)
    +--------------------------+----------+
    |   8275 CRT, PIO kbd,     |  SIO-A   |
    |   SIO-B console, FDC,    |  async   |
    |   CTC, IM2 IVT           |  9600..  |
    +--------------------------+----------+
       local hardware             wire
```

- **BIOS — talks to local hardware.** CRT (8275), keyboard (PIO), SIO/serial
  console, FDC, CTC, IM2 IVT. Exposes the standard 17-entry CP/M jump
  table (BOOT/WBOOT/CONST/CONIN/CONOUT/LIST/PUNCH/READER/HOME/SELDSK/
  SETTRK/SETSEC/SETDMA/READ/WRITE/LISTST/SECTRAN). Lives at 0xED00 in
  the resident image.

- **SNIOS — talks to the CP/NET server, "somehow".** 8 entries at 0xEA00
  (NTWKIN/NTWKST/CNFTBL/SNDMSG/RCVMSG/NTWKER/NTWKBT/NTWKDN). Today
  "somehow" = SIO-A async to z80pack on TCP 4002. Tomorrow it could be
  J3 parallel to a Pico bridge — only the SNIOS body changes; NDOS
  above it never notices.

- **NDOS — the router.** Sits in front of BDOS in `cpnos.com`. Decides per
  BDOS call whether to handle it locally (via BDOS+BIOS) or send it
  out over the wire (via SNIOS). Generic DRI code, vendor-neutral.

So the rule of thumb:

- **BIOS = local I/O, one box.**
- **SNIOS = remote I/O, one wire to one server.**
- **NDOS = decides which of the two each BDOS call goes to.**

Everything RC702-specific is in this PROM (BIOS + SNIOS). `cpnos.com`'s
only piece of RC702 knowledge is the address `NIOS = 0xEA00` — i.e.
"the SNIOS jump table lives here" — resolved at link time. Swap the
RC702 for a different CP/NOS slave and you'd rewrite this PROM; you'd
not touch `cpnos.com`.

## Architecture invariant: CP/NOS is diskless

A CP/NOS slave does NOT support local drives.  All disk I/O goes
through NDOS to the master via SNIOS over the wire — that's what
makes it CP/NET-OS rather than CP/M-with-network-drives.  CFGTBL
drive entries on the slave are either `NET_DRV(...)` (network drive)
or `0x0000` (no drive); local-floppy mounting is not part of the
CP/NOS architecture.

Historical note: an `ENABLE_FDC=1` build option exists in the
Makefile from a never-completed hybrid-mode design.  No C source
currently consumes the macro, so it's a no-op build flag — kept for
backwards compatibility with build scripts that pass it through.
Don't propose adding back local-floppy support; that would be a
different OS.

## Build configurations

- `make cpnos` — single config, NOS-only over CP/NET, targets ~55-56 KB TPA

Both produce a 4096-byte image split into `prom0.bin` (0x0000–0x07FF) and
`prom1.bin` (0x2000–0x27FF) for burning.

## Design constraints

- Display RAM at 0xF800–0xFFFF unchanged (Comal80 compatibility).
- BIOS resident code relocated to high RAM before PROM disable.
- Single OUT (0x18) disables both PROMs; everything needed at runtime must
  be in RAM by that point.
- Transport abstracted behind a vtable — parallel port (J3/J4) is parked
  but drops in without restructuring.

## Compiler tuning notes

This ROM is dual-built by clang (LLVM Z80 backend at `ravn/llvm-z80`)
and SDCC (z88dk's `zsdcc` 4.5.0).  Both compilers target the same
Z80 ISA with the same register pressure, but they need very
different optimizer-flag settings to produce small code.  The
findings below come from a per-flag bisection (see Phases 62-63 in
`tasks/timeline.md`):

### clang (LLVM Z80)

The production Makefile sets:
```
-Oz -nostdlib -g
-Xclang -target-feature -Xclang +static-stack
-mllvm -disable-lsr
-mllvm -disable-machine-licm
-mllvm -disable-machine-cse
```

| flag | role | net Δ on snios_c.o |
|---|---|---:|
| `+static-stack` | locals to per-function BSS instead of IX-frame | **−450 B** (without it, IX-relative addressing dominates) |
| `-disable-lsr` | skip Loop Strength Reduction | −7 B |
| `-disable-machine-licm` | skip Loop-Invariant Code Motion (machine-IR pass) | −73 B |
| `-disable-machine-cse` | skip Machine Common Subexpression Elimination | −11 B |

The three "disable" flags work around a Z80-LLVM regalloc cost-model
limitation (see `ravn/llvm-z80#128`): MachineLICM and MachineCSE
hoist values they assume the regalloc can keep in registers, but
Z80's `TargetTransformInfo` under-predicts spill cost, so the
hoisted values get force-spilled to BSS (3 B per access, repeated
inside the loop or at every CSE use site).  Disabling lets the
recompute stay inline, where Z80 prefers it.

Tested but not adopted:
- `-disable-block-placement` — would save another 8 B but pushes
  init.c 1 B over the 640 B INIT_CODE region budget; deferred to
  `ravn/rc700-gensmedet#93`.

### SDCC (z88dk)

The production Makefile sets:
```
-SO3 --sdcccall 1 --max-allocs-per-node 1000000 --fomit-frame-pointer
--allow-unsafe-read --std-sdcc23
```

The SDCC-side equivalents of clang's "disable" flags are
**counterproductive on this code**:

| SDCC flag | clang analog | Δ on snios_c.o |
|---|---|---:|
| `--noinvariant` | `-disable-machine-licm` | 0 (no-op here) |
| `--noloopreverse` | (none) | 0 (no-op) |
| `--nogcse` | `-disable-machine-cse` | **+88 B** |
| `--nolabelopt` | (none) | **+116 B** |
| `--noinduction` | `-disable-lsr` | **+140 B** |

The asymmetry is the diagnostic finding: clang and SDCC compile the
same C code, target the same ISA, hit the same register pressure —
but clang benefits from disabling LICM/CSE while SDCC suffers.
Architecturally:

- **clang/LLVM** runs MachineLICM and MachineCSE *after* instruction
  selection but *before* register allocation, deciding what to hoist
  using `TargetTransformInfo` cost estimates.  Z80's TTI is
  incomplete (open Cluster A: `ravn/llvm-z80#94`, `#98`, `#89`,
  `#95`), so the cost model under-predicts spill weight.
- **SDCC** runs all loop optimizations on its higher-level iCode
  with the iCode allocator running concurrently — invariants are
  hoisted only when a register is available; CSE is budgeted
  against register count.  No "hoist first, hope regalloc handles
  it" path.

Practical takeaway: the LICM/CSE pessimization is a Z80-LLVM
cost-model problem, not a fundamental C-on-Z80 constraint.  SDCC's
flag set is already optimal for its model; only clang needs the
backend-tuning workarounds.

### Source-level patterns that help both compilers

A handful of source-level idioms in `snios_c.c` give size wins on
*both* compilers:

- **Timeout-folding trick**: `xport_recv_byte` returns `0xFFFF` on
  timeout.  Since `0xFFFF & 0x7F = 0x7F` and no CP/NET 1.2 control
  byte is `0x7F`, the explicit `if (r >= 0x100) return RETRY` check
  can fold into the existing `(r & 0x7F) != EXPECTED` check at
  every receive site that compares against a known control byte
  (SOH, STX, ETX, EOT, ENQ, ACK).  Saves ~4 B per fold site.
  Phase 62 net: −44 B clang.

- **Direct sentinel test**: prefer `if (slaveid != 0xFF)` over
  `if ((uint8_t)(slaveid + 1) != 0)` — both express "slaveid is
  not the init-mode wildcard," but the direct form generates one
  fewer instruction.

- **Store-then-readback over named-temporary in tight loops**: in
  patterns like `*p = (uint8_t)r; sum += *p++;`, leaving the byte
  unnamed avoids forcing SDCC's iCode allocator to push the named
  temp to the IX-frame.  Clang doesn't care which form.  See
  `feedback_dont_fight_sdcc_icode` rule.

### Cumulative impact (May 2026 session)

| | clang payload | SDCC resident |
|---|---:|---:|
| HEAD pre-investigation | 2138 B | 2152 B |
| HEAD post-Phase-63 | 2004 B | 2120 B |
| Δ | **−134 B (−6.3 %)** | **−32 B (−1.5 %)** |

Both compilers PASS the 4-cell `cpnos-polypascal-test` at parity
through every change.

  (`cpnet-z80/src/ser-dri/snios.asm`), and current cpnos-rom slave.
  Documents one slave-side deviation (busy-wait mid-frame receive)

  rejected by our master — slave ID is hardcoded via
  `RC702_SLAVEID=0x01` in the Makefile.
